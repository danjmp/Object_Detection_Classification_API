# Object_Detection_Classification_API
Object Detection and Classification Using TensorFlow (CPU) on Windows 10.

This notebook shows how I have implemented a object detection and classification in my own data using tensorflow (CPU) in windows 10. The images and their correspondent .xml files used to train and test the model can be found at [Train](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vlWorJj8fGoSXAxlyCReC9ujBYdMGbL2/view?usp=sharing) and [Test](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VsyuFAGZ2Dp22U9nUgoP24XqZn_kduNP/view?usp=sharing).
